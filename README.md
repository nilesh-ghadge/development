changefileextensions: This project was developed to serve a simple feature to change all the files with same extensions to another extension. The need cropped up when I bought a new TV with USB support and did support only a few video formats. I had Some of my videos, unfortunately, weren't supported. A simple trick helped: change the file extension from mov --> mp4. Since I had a bunch of videos and changing them one by one would be a pain, I wrote this simple project to allow me to change the file extensions.
